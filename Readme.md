This repository holds code for some of the solutions to coding problems on geeksforgeeks.
The primary purpose for maintaining this repository is for interview preparation.

The solutions to problems can be found as seperate cs files with the name of the file indicating the name of the problem.

Along with the cs files, there exists a folder named "solution" which contains code for a template csproj and a program.cs file.

In order to run a particular cs file. Follow the steps listed below:

1. Open the solution/solution.csproj in Visual Studio IDE.
2. Copy the code from the file which you want to run and paste it into the Program.cs file in the solution.
3. Build and run the code using Ctrl + F5 in Visual Studio.
